# Haru - A TUI Anime Tracker

## (Planned) Features
- [ ] Can track anime in the same way as popular trackers
- [ ] Works completely from the terminal
- [ ] Can import/export from most popular anime trackers
- [ ] Can search and add to list via MAL's API
- [ ] Saves data in a local database (in ~/.haru)
- [ ] Can export/import in it's own format for backing up

## Usage/Examples

`TODO`

## Why

I have had data stored across several tracking websites for years, and feel it'd be easier to just bring them all to one place and manage things from the terminal, where it's most convenient for me. Even if someone doesn't want to use the TUI, this may be useful for importing from one anime tracking service to another that doesn't have that functionality built in.

## Dev Requirements
- Go (of course)
- SQLC
- Sqlite
